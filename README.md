This repository contains most *(except for a select few)* of the
AMXX plugins I have ever written.

Most of these plugins have been battletested on [mY.RuN](http://my-run.de)
community servers. And some of plugins have a lot of hardcoded configuration.

All these plugins are released as-is, and I will not be providing any support.
